## General Information
- When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Our aim is to identify patterns that indicate if a person is likely to default using loan data issued through the time period 2007 – 2011.
The company can utilize this knowledge for risk assessment.
